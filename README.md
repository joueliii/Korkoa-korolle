Korkoa korolle -laskuri / Compound Interest Calculator

I made a compound interest calculator that can be used e.g. to calculate growth in stock investments over a given period of time.
Principal amount means your initial capital. Interest rate is the percentual growth in a certain period, in this calculator per year. (In stock market the average return is 7% per year)

This calculator can be used for other things than stocks too if you know the annual growth.
